        <h3>ABOUT UBA</h3>
        <p>
          The conceptualization of Unnat Bharat Abhiyan originated from the
          endeavours of a dedicated group of faculty members at the Indian
          Institute of Technology (IIT) Delhi, possessing expertise in rural
          development and appropriate technology. The concept evolved through
          extensive consultations with representatives from various technical
          institutions, Rural Technology Action Group (RuTAG) coordinators,
          voluntary organizations, and government agencies actively engaged in
          rural development. <br /><br />
          These deliberations took place during a national workshop hosted at
          IIT Delhi in September 2014, sponsored by the Council for Advancement
          of Peopleâ€™s Action and Rural Technology (CAPART), Ministry of Rural
          Development, Government of India.
